# Minely
Share your Minecraft LAN world with players outside of your home.

Install globally for future use:
`npm i -g minely`

Install and run:
`npx minely`

## What does Minely do?
Minely allows you to allow people outside of your internet to access your LAN world without the need for port forwarding. This is done by creating a TCP tunnel between you and our TCP server.

This process also hides your IP address from people joining your world.
